# Experiments

The experiments folders contains the Arduino signal generator used, the expected pattern according to these parameters and the actual measured pattern.
* Experiment 1: constant amplitude law, no phase law (steering angle = 0°),
* Experiment 2: constant amplitude law, phase law (steering angle = 30°),
* Experiment 3: linear log amplitude law, no phase law (steering angle = 0°).

The measurement were performed on my 12 speaker array with 15cm spacing between the elements.

Note: outliers were filtered out from raw data
